# Project Title: Traffic Object Detection

This is a comprehensive project composed of a frontend, backend and prototype architecture designed to interact synergistically for an ambitious task - Traffic Object Detection!

Features include the ability to upload an image, upload a YouTube link, as well as visualise videos frame by frame. The backend of this project is constructed using Flask, while the frontend is beautifully rendered using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS.

## Prototype
The prototype is built with Streamlit, a fast, elegant, and interactive tool for building data science web applications. The attached illustration of car detection has been achieved using this functionality.
